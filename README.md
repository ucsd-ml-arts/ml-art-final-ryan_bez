# Final Project

Ryan Bez, rbez@ucsd.edu


## Abstract Proposal

For the final project I plan to revisit aspects of generative text, audio, and visuals. I am expanding on my first project by updating the dataset, doing more extensive training, and recoding the outputs to be more like a normal conversation. I then plan to visit generative audio by feeding this generated text into different computer voices, such as tacotron2 or DeepVoice3. Lastly, I will revisit oscilloscope music by creating artistic displays for any musical interludes generated in the texts. Lastly I will load up all these audio files into Ableton and edit them into a cohesive "podcast."
## Project Report

- Oscilloscope Podcast.pdf

## Code

- Reply All Web Scraper.ipynb - this jupyter notebook contains the code I used, primarily BeautifulSoup, to pull each episode's transcript and print it to a text file
- Final Training and Text Generation.ipynb - this jupyter notebook contains both the code used to train the model as well the text generation methods, this is based primarily on the in class Shakespeare exercise with modifications for working with my training data and text generation flexibility

## Model/Data

- The training data is generated by the Reply All Web Scraper
- This is then trained on to build a model for use in Final Training and Text Generation

## Results

- Final.wav: The completed audio file, that includes a visual element when played on an oscilloscope.
- Script.pdf: A stylized script of the audio podcast to follow along with

## Technical Notes

To repeat my process simply restart & clear output on each notebook, then run "Reply All Web Scraper" and move the output text files into the a folder. From that folder now run "Final Training and Text Generation" and view the generated texts. Be sure to move them to the a separate folder before running the model training again so they don't also get accidentally read in and trained on.

- I did not have to do any additional pip installs, a few packages are imported as required, but this is outlined in the first cell of each notebook.

- As long as the other platforms had the required packages installed, such as BeautifulSoup, then there should be no issues with running it on other platforms. Time spent training the model and generating texts will vary based on your local hardware.
